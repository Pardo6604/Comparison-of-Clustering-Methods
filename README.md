## Lloyd’s algorithm (“k-means”) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering on two datasets:
- The first dataset, dataset1.csv, consists of 3500 two-dimensional examples. These examples were generated by a Gaussian mixture model.
- The second dataset, dataset2.csv, consists of 14,801 three-dimensional examples.

For each version of Lloyd’s algorithm (uniform random initialization and k-means++ initialization), different values of k were tested (starting from 2 and increasing) and, for each value of k, the method was ran multiple times and the best result was recorded. 

For each version of hierarchical agglomerative clustering (single linkage and average linkage), the final clustering to pick was decided by making a cut in the dendrogram. Since the number of examples is very large, option truncate_mode = “lastp” was used, in order to avoid showing too many lower levels of the dendrogram.

The final report can be found as a pdf file named "report.pdf"



## Intructions to run code.ipynb:

1. Open code.ipynb in a Jupyter enviroment.

2. If necessary install the required libraries of the first coding cell.

3. Adjust the directory path in the third cell in the lines "data_1 = pd.read_csv("dataset1.csv")
data_2 = pd.read_csv("dataset2.csv")" if necessary.

4. Run all code cells to see the results.
